               answering counterfactual questions such as, ``Would this patient
               have lower blood sugar had she received a different
               medication?``. We propose a new algorithmic framework for
               counterfactual inference which brings together ideas from domain
               adaptation and representation learning. In addition to a
               theoretical justification, we perform an empirical comparison
               with previous approaches to causal inference from observational
               data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the
               previous state-of-the-art.",

  abstract  = "We show how deep learning methods can be applied in the context
               of crowdsourcing and unsupervised ensemble learning. First, we
               prove that the popular model of Dawid and Skene, which assumes
               that all classifiers are conditionally independent, is
               equivalent to a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with a single
               hidden node. Hence, under this model, the posterior
               probabilities of the true labels can be instead estimated via a
               trained RBM. Next, to address the more general case, where
               classifiers may strongly violate the conditional independence
               assumption, we propose to apply RBM-based Deep Neural Net (DNN).
               Experimental results on various simulated and real-world
               datasets demonstrate that our proposed DNN approach outperforms
               other state-of-the-art methods, in particular when the data
               violates the conditional independence assumption.",
