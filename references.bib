               answering counterfactual questions such as, ``Would this patient
               have lower blood sugar had she received a different
               medication?``. We propose a new algorithmic framework for
               counterfactual inference which brings together ideas from domain
               adaptation and representation learning. In addition to a
               theoretical justification, we perform an empirical comparison
               with previous approaches to causal inference from observational
               data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the
               previous state-of-the-art.",

               of crowdsourcing and unsupervised ensemble learning. First, we
               prove that the popular model of Dawid and Skene, which assumes
               that all classifiers are conditionally independent, is
               equivalent to a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with a single
               hidden node. Hence, under this model, the posterior
               probabilities of the true labels can be instead estimated via a
               trained RBM. Next, to address the more general case, where
               classifiers may strongly violate the conditional independence
               assumption, we propose to apply RBM-based Deep Neural Net (DNN).
               Experimental results on various simulated and real-world
               datasets demonstrate that our proposed DNN approach outperforms
               other state-of-the-art methods, in particular when the data
               violates the conditional independence assumption.",
