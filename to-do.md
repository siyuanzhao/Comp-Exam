### Individual treatment rules
- statistical model for treatment assignment
- should have a better understanding the diff between OWL and RWL
- both models use reproducing kernel
- should better understand the representer theorem which converts the optimization problem to fininte dimension

### Gaussian processes
- should start to read papers on Gaussian processes + bandits problem
- only have a rough idea on how Gaussian process is connected to Bayesian optimization

### ensemble learning
- deep learning approach
- lots of variants of Bayesian approach (belief propagation, minimax entropy, exact exponent)
- add control problem to evaluate workers' reliable

### Bayesian optimization
- start to get a clear idea on Bayesian optimization
- should investigate the diff between Bayesian optimization and most commonly used contextual bandits approaches
